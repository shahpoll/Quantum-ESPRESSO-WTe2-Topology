# The Physics of 1T'-WTe₂

## Why is it Topological?
Unlike standard semiconductors, WTe₂ derives its topology from a band inversion driven by strong Spin-Orbit Coupling in the Tungsten atoms ($5d$ orbitals).

### 1. Peierls Distortion
The Structure is a distorted phase of the 1T geometry.

### 2. Orbital Inversion
The inversion occurs between the Te-$p$ and W-$d$ orbitals.

### 3. Spin-Orbit Gap Opening
