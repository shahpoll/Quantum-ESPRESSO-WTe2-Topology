# Appendix 1: Orbital Projections (Corrected)

| Ion | Orbital ($l$) | Projections ($m$) | Physics Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **W** | $d$ ($l=2$) | $d_{z^2}, d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{xz}$ | Conduction Bands / Dominant SOC |
| **Te** | $p$ ($l=1$) | $p_x, p_y, p_z$ | Valence Bands / $p$-$d$ Inversion Partner |

## Computational Methods (Notes)
- **Vacuum:** The 17.6 Å spacing prevents "crosstalk" between periodic images (layer-to-layer interaction is effectively zero).
- **Frozen Window:** Extending this to $+2.0$ eV was the key to stabilizing the high-energy conduction bands in the Wannier model.
